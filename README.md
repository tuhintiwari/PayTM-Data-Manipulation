## Author: Tuhin Tiwari
## Data and Challenge Provider: PayTM Labs Toronto

#### Due to some constraints, I had to reupload my work and hence there are two versions of the notebook on the repo currently
#### As communicated to the HR, I would request the late submission to be considered and evaluate the updated version which can be found here: https://github.com/tuhintiwari/PayTM_Challenge/blob/main/PayTM_Coding_Challenge_Updated.ipynb

This repo contains the Jupyter notebook created on Databricks environment (Spark 3.0.1 cluster)for the purpose of PayTM MLE Coding Challenge

The Notebook is also publicly available on: https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/6544054900743082/1995244107513420/4954129356399402/latest.html

The data has not been uploaded and the assumption is that after cloning this repo, you should save the data in the following mount(for successful running): '/FileStore/tables/' otherwise change it according to your environment
